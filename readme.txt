== Description ==

Wp title lister is a plugin which is arranged for especially archive sites of wide blogs.

Archive sites have millions of context and their biggest problem is that when their context numbers increase, the control mechanism gets worse. A new registration has to be controlled whether they are among the posts which were registered to WordPress before or not. However, the control stage is not really easy. We can either control it from the search button in the front side of WordPress or we can control it from the admin panel by searching for the writing part, but doing that means labouring and losing lots of time of yours.
Wp title lister is a great solution for this, with ajax infrastructure, you can easily check if the title you are looking for has been added on WordPress before or not.
